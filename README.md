# Telco Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques and end-to-end deployment. It was developed as part of the **AI Data Science Track ‚Äì Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative**.

We use the [Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) and implement the full data science lifecycle ‚Äî from data cleaning and model building to deployment and monitoring.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze factors driving customer churn
- Develop predictive models using classification algorithms
- Compare model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC
- Deploy the best model with FastAPI
- Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit
- Monitor predictions and trigger retraining with MLflow

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Pipeline

### Core Components:
- **API:** FastAPI (`churn_api.py`)
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit (`app.py`)
- **Monitoring:** MLflow (`monitoring.py`)
- **Model Serving:** Serialized with `joblib`/`pickle`

### `/predict` Endpoint
Accepts customer details in JSON and returns:
- Churn prediction (`0` or `1`)
- Probability score
